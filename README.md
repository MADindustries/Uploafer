Automate your music uploads.

### How does autotunes work? ###
### NOTE THAT THESE FEATURES DO NOT YET FUNCTION ###

* Scans through your music directory, checking existing data against stored torrent hashes
* When a hash matches and data integrity is confirmed, it parses ReleaseInfo.txt for release data
* It then contacts MusicBrainz to supplement missing information for the release
* It will check against PTH to attempt to find an existing group
* If no group is found, it will create a torrent, find album artwork if necessary, and upload to PTH automatically.
* When a group is found, it will ask you to manually confirm the upload by checking PTH to prevent duplicates

### How do I get set up? ###
